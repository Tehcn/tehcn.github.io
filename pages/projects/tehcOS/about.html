  <h3>What is tehcOS?</h3>
  tehcOS is my attempt at making an operating system for programming. It should
  be fast, lightweight, and support lots of programs (this is hard).

  <h3>Goals</h3>
  Some of my goals for tehcOS include: a full terminal, networking, and
  (eventually) a <i>toggleable</i> desktop environment. Of course, each of these
  will be difficult to implement, the bugs and problems that I encounter along
  the way will likely give me a headache.
