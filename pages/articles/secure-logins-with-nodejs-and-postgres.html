  <h3>Some Background</h3>
  <p>
    I've seen some pretty atrocious code produced by amateur backend devs... of
    course, I was once one of these people. Thankfully, I often discuss projects
    I'm working on with my dad (who's been in the industry for decades) and he
    was able to correct some of my harmful practices. Some were worse than
    others, one of the worse ones being using JSON files as databases for user
    data. Worst of all, I stored passwords of my users in
    <i>plaintext</i>... yeah. So, this article exists to help new backend devs
    avoid some serious security flaws that many people experience.

  <h3>Step 1: Setup Code</h3>
  <p>
    To begin, if you want to follow along with the code you have to have NodeJS
    v12 or greater for it to be guaranteed to work (if you don't make any
    mistakes). This guide will NOT go over how to install NodeJS.
  </p>
  <p>
    Create a new folder wherever you store your code and open it however you
    like (if you haven't yet chosen an editor, I'd recommend reading
    <a>this article</a>). Create a file called <code>index.js</code>, as this
    will be the entrypoint for our program.
  </p>
  <pre>

<code class="language-shell">$ npm init -y</code>
</pre>
  We will use the npm packages <code>node-postgres</code> and
  <code>express</code>
  <pre>

<code class="language-shell">$ npm i pg express</code>
</pre>
  To finish setup, let's check that everything's working as expected by writing
  a basic Express server.
  <pre>

<code class="language-js">// index.js
const express = require('express');
const mysql = require('mysql');

const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello World!');
});

const port = 3000;

app.listen(port, () => { console.log(`server running on port ${port}`)});</code>
</pre>
  If that code runs without errors, and if you can (if you're working locally)
  visit <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000/</a>, then,
  congratulations, you've finished half of the setup. Now, for the harder part.

  <h3>Step 3: Creating a Database and Tables</h3>
  We are at the point where we should consider what demo to make to prove that
  we can actually make a functional project with these technologies. A good and
  relatively simple app to implement is a todo app, so let's do that! Creating a
  database is actually really simple. In your psql shell, just run the following
  query:
  <pre>

<code class="language-sql">CREATE DATABASE todo;
</code>
</pre>
  Next, we'll create two tables: a user table and a todo table. Todo so (see
  what I did there), we'll run two queries.
  <pre>
<code class="language-sql">
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    username VARCHAR(127) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
</code>
</pre>
  This first query creates a new table called <code>users</code>. The
  <code>id</code> column is our primary key for our table (meaning it uniquely
  identifies each row). Notice the data type is <code>SERIAL</code>. This is the
  Postgres equivalent to SQL Server's <code>AUTO_INCREMENT</code>. It
  automatically increments the field with each addition.
