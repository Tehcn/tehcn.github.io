  <h3>Some Background</h3>
  <p>
    I started coding roughly {{ Math.floor(((new Date().getTime() - new
    Date(2017, 0, 1).getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)) / 364.25).toString() }}
    years ago. I started with a drag-and-drop block based "language" (really it
    was just Java). It was a great introduction to the fundamentals of
    programming for me. Eventually, I realized that I was spending more time
    searching for the blocks I wanted, when I already knew exactly what to type
    anyway. Luckily, there was a <i>pro mode</i> (which was literally just
    Java). This was my first show of preference in code editors.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, I program mostly in C, Rust, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS, and I've come
    to realize that a programmer's editor should fit their needs and wants
    without any bloat.
  </p>
  <h3>My Setup</h3>
  <p>
    I use windows. There are two reasons why I haven't switched over to linux.
    First, a virtual machine is good enough (I give Ubuntu 4 processors and 6GB
    of ram). And second, is gaming. I like games, what can I say?
  </p>
  <p>
    I am sad to report, but my main code editor is VS Code. Once again, there
    are two main reasons for this. One, I haven't wanted to dedicate the time to
    learn vim keybindings, and two, I've just used VS Code for a long time now.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, when using linux, I use Neovim. I do like my setup, but without
    knowing proper keybinds, it feels slow and unproductive, at least compared
    to VS Code. If I'm being honest, I would absolutely love to switch to
    Neovim, but I'm just not sure if I'm ready to put in the time to learn it. I
    believe it would be more than worth the eventual speed boost, but I'm an
    admittedly terrible procrastinator if I don't have to do something.
  </p>
  <h3>The other ones...</h3>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, as I enjoy Minecraft modding, I touch Java more than I'd like
    (but I still won't learn Kotlin). I originally tried to use Eclipse, but, in
    all honesty, it was bad. It was a big memory hog, and with only 16GB to
    spread between <s>StackOverflow</s> my browser (Brave), editor, music
    player, and Minecraft... well I'm sure you can imagine how well that worked,
    but in case you can't: it didn't. Eventually, I switched to Intellij Idea
    Community Edition, and it sucks slightly less.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've also tried Sublime Text, which had too many popups, and Atom, which
    just felt off.
  </p>
  <h3>Will I ever switch to Neovim?</h3>
  <p>
    I really hope so, but, knowing myself, probably not. I'd probably have to
    use linux as my main OS for that to happen, and I'm already locked into the
    Microsoft ecosystem.
